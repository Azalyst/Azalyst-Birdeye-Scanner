# Birdeye Whale Tracking - Complete Guide

## Overview

This agent now includes comprehensive whale tracking capabilities for Birdeye.so, implementing the complete workflow for tracking whale wallets, detecting pump/dump signals, and finding hidden gem tokens before they moon.

## 🎯 Complete Workflow (Aaj Pump Pakdna Hai Toh)

### Step 1: Whale Ka Wallet Pakad (Find Whale Wallets)

Use the "Find Trades" feature to track large value transactions:

```
/agent find_pumps
```

This scans for:
- Tokens with unusual volume spikes
- Large buy/sell transactions (>$10K)
- Smart money movements
- Early accumulation patterns

**Workflow:**
1. Agent checks trending tokens (24H)
2. Identifies unusual volume/price spikes
3. Extracts whale wallet addresses from large trades
4. Returns top whale movements sorted by value

### Step 2: Wallet Deep Dive

Once you have a whale wallet address:

```
/agent track_whale wallet_address=<WALLET_ADDRESS>
```

**This returns:**
- Total portfolio value
- Top 10 held tokens
- Recent transaction history
- Accumulation/distribution patterns

**Example:**
```
/agent track_whale wallet_address=7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU
```

### Step 3: Pump Aane Se Pehle Signals (Pre-Pump Detection)

Analyze specific tokens for pump signals:

```
/agent analyze_token token_address=<TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

**Checks for:**
- ✅ **GREEN FLAGS (Pump Signals)**
  - Smart wallets accumulating
  - Volume 10x in 1H
  - New holders spike (>500 in 24h)
  - Whale bought newly launched token
  - Low holder concentration (<30% top 10)

- ⚠️ **RED FLAGS (Dump Signals)**
  - Large wallet outflows
  - LP pulled suddenly (>20% drop)
  - Holder count dropping
  - Dev wallet selling
  - Community exit pattern

**Example:**
```
/agent analyze_token token_address=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v
```

### Step 4: Hidden Gem Filter (Early Pump Detection)

Find tokens with pump potential BEFORE they trend:

```
/agent find_pumps
```

**Filters Applied:**
- Token age <24 hours
- Liquidity pool >$2K
- Volume growth >$10K in 1H
- Holder growth pattern
- Security checks (not mintable, fair distribution)

**Returns:**
- Top 10 gems ranked by score (0-100)
- Age, volume, liquidity metrics
- Holder count and growth rate
- Risk assessment

### Step 5: Daily Comprehensive Scan

Run complete analysis across all metrics:

```
/agent daily_scan
```

**This generates a full report with:**
1. Trending token analysis (top 20)
2. Whale trade movements (top 10)
3. Hidden gems (top 10)
4. Watchlist updates (all tracked wallets)
